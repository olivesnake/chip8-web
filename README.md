# improvements

- struggling to get function pointer opcode table functionality working, it isn't critical but it would certainly be
  nice.
- some roms still do not work exactly as in intended, however opcodes have been double and triple-checked, probably
  something i'm missing.

# issues

- if you download this repo, it seems the development version seems to work much better then the production version.
